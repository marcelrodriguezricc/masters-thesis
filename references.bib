	abstract = {The shallow waters of the nearshore ocean are popular, dynamic, and often hostile. Prediction in this domain is usually limited less by our understanding of the physics or by the power of our models than by the availability of input data, such as bathymetry and wave conditions. It is a challenge for traditional in situ instruments to provide these inputs with the appropriate temporal or spatial density or at reasonable logistical or ﬁnancial costs. Remote sensing provides an attractive alternative. We discuss the range of different sensors that are available and the differing physical manifestations of their interactions with the ocean surface. We then present existing algorithms by which the most important geophysical variables can be estimated from remote sensing measurements. Future directions and opportunities will depend on expected developments in sensors and platforms and on improving processing algorithms, including data assimilation formalisms.},

	abstract = {Climate change is resulting in global changes to sea level and wave climates, which in many locations significantly increase the probability of erosion, flooding and damage to coastal infrastructure and ecosystems. Therefore, there is a pressing societal need to be able to forecast the morphological evolution of our coastlines over a broad range of timescales, spanning days-to-decades, facilitating more focused, appropriate and cost-effective management interventions and data-informed planning to support the development of coastal environments. A wide range of modelling approaches have been used with varying degrees of success to assess both the detailed morphological evolution and/or simplified indicators of coastal erosion/accretion. This paper presents an overview of these modelling approaches, covering the full range of the complexity spectrum and summarising the advantages and disadvantages of each method. A focus is given to reduced-complexity modelling approaches, including models based on equilibrium concepts, which have emerged as a particularly promising methodology for the prediction of coastal change over multi-decadal timescales. The advantages of stable, computationally-efficient, reduced-complexity models must be balanced against the requirement for good generality and skill in diverse and complex coastal settings. Significant obstacles are also identified, limiting the generic application of models at regional and global scales. Challenges include the accurate long-term prediction of model forcing time-series in a changing climate, and accounting for processes that can largely be ignored in the shorter term but increase in importance in the long term. Further complications include coastal complexities, such as the accurate assessment of the impacts of headland bypassing. Additional complexities include complex structures and geology, mixed grain size, limited sediment supply, sources and sinks. It is concluded that with present computational resources, data availability limitations and process knowledge gaps, reduced-complexity modelling approaches currently offer the most promising solution to modelling shoreline evolution on daily-to-decadal timescales.},

	abstract = {This contribution describes the development, calibration and verification of a 1-D behaviour-orientated shoreline prediction model. The model primarily encapsulates shoreline displacement forced by wave-driven cross-shore sediment transport. Hysteresis effects are shown to be important and are included in the model, whereby present shoreline change is influenced by past hydro-/morpho-dynamic conditions. The potential magnitude of shoreline change increases with incident wave power and the degree of disequilibrium. The latter disequilibrium term (Ωeq−Ω) is expressed in terms of the time-evolving equilibrium (Ωeq) and instantaneous (Ω) dimensionless fall velocities and dictates the direction of shoreline movement. Following Wright et al. (1985) the equilibrium fall velocity is defined as a function of the weighted antecedent conditions and is a proxy for the evolving beach state. The decay rate of the weighting function used to compute Ωeq is a model free parameter determined by calibration against measured data, which physically reflects the degree of observed ‘memory’ of the system. The decay in amplitude of this weighting function with time is controlled by a ‘memory decay’ term (ϕ), where the weighting reaches 10\%, 1\% and 0.1\% at ϕ, 2ϕ and 3ϕ days prior to the current calculation time. The model is applied to two multi-year (6+ years) data sets incorporating hourly wave and weekly shoreline measurements, from two contrasting energetic sites in {SE} Australia. The first is the relatively dissipative, straight Gold Coast ({QLD}) and the second is a more intermediate embayed beach at Narrabeen ({NSW}). The model shows significant skill at hindcasting shoreline change at both sites, predicting approximately 60\% of the total shoreline variability. The Gold Coast shoreline is dominated by a strong seasonal signal. Conversely, at the Narrabeen embayment, shoreline variability (and morphology) is more dynamic, responding at storm frequency. Evidence suggests that there is a strong coherence between the shoreline position and morphodynamic state and that both have response times characterised by ϕ. It is hypothesised that optimised ϕ values in the shoreline model physically relate to the efficiency of sediment exchanges between the shoreface and offshore bars and the prevalence of one- or two-dimensional horizontal circulation. The general success of this new shoreline model for hindcasting the observed shoreline behaviour at two distinctly different open-coast sites suggests that this approach may be suitable for broader application.},

The measured longshore current variations at tidal frequency are the same order of magnitude as the mean longshore current variations for moderate wave height conditions, indicating that the tide is a dominant mechanism associated with longshore current variability. Simulations of the magnitude and phase of the longshore current variability with tide elevation using the model by Thornton and Guza (1986) are used to explain observations. The measured tidal elevation and longshore current are in phase in the inner surf zone and out of phase in the outer surf zone as predicted by the model, verifying the hypothesis.},

	abstract = {A new class of nearshore waves based on the shear instability of a steady longshore current is discussed. The dynamics depend on the conservation of potential vorticity but with the background vorticity field, traditionally the role of Coriolis in larger scale flows, supplied by the shear structure of the longshore current. The resulting vorticity waves are longshore-progressive with celerities roughly equal to V0/3, where V0 is the peak longshore current velocity. A natural frequency scaling for the problem is fs, the shear of the seaward face of the longshore current. While the instability can span a range of frequencies and wavenumbers, a representative frequency is given by 0.07fs, typically in the range of 10−3–10−2 Hz (called the Far Infragravity, or {FIG}, band because frequencies are just below those of the infragravity band). Wavelengths are of the order of 2x0, where x0 is the width of the longshore current. Growth is exponential with an e-folding time that is typically half of a wave period. Field data, presented in the companion paper [Oltman-Shay et al., this issue], demonstrate the presence of energetic motions from a natural beach whose behavior matches the theory in many aspects. Results from the model suggest that shear instability will be more important on barred, rather than monotonic beach profiles, a result of the stronger shears expected over the bar crest. Since vorticity waves will probably have a profound effect on cross-shore mixing as well as longshore current dissipation, we expect the dynamics of barred and monotonic beaches to show fundamental differences.},

Root-mean-square wave heights, Hrms, are found across the surf zone by numerical iteration, and compare well with field data acquired on both barred and near-planar beaches. The model has two free parameters, σ, the mean angle to vertical of the wave/roller interface roughly representing the type of breaker, and γ, a measure of breaking wave saturation equal to the ratio of Hrms to local depth. Optimal values of both parameters are chosen by model fitting, and show the model to be insensitive to σ. Although the model is sensitive to the choice of γ, values are consistent with field data. The surface roller model behaves similarly to the bore dissipation model of Thornton and Guza for a particular parameter choice, and is used to decrease model dependence to one input parameter, γ.},

	abstract = {The data for the spectrums of fully developed seas obtained by Moskowitz [1964] for wind speeds from 20 to 40 knots (10.29 to 20.58 m/sec), are used to test the similarity hypothesis and the idea proposed by Kitaigorodskii [1961] that, when plotted in a certain dimensionless way, the power spectrums for all fully developed seas should be of the same shape. Over the important range of frequencies that define the total variance of the spectrum within a few per cent, the transformed plots yield a nondimensional spectral form that is nearly the same over this entire range of wind speeds within the present accuracies of the data. However, since slight variations of the wind speed have large effects on the location of this nondimensional spectral form, inaccuracies in the determination of the wind speed at sea allow for some latitude in the final choice of the form of the spectrum. Also, since the winds used to obtain the nondimensional form were measured at a height greater than 10 meters, the problem of relating the spectral form to a standard anemometer height arises. The variability introduced by this factor needs to be considered. The results, when errors in the wind speed, the sampling variability of the data, and the anemometer heights are considered, suggest a spectral form that is a compromise between the various proposed spectrums and that has features similar to many of them. A spectral form is recommended for tentative application to the problem of wave forecasting by spectral techniques. Improved wind speed measurements (taken at several elevations and averaged over longer time intervals) and better wave data (taken for longer time intervals and analyzed so as to better fit the procedures) are needed so that the form of the spectrums of fully developed wind seas and seas limited by either fetch or duration can be determined with even greater precision.},

During the Last Glacial Maximum ({LGM}) the eustatic sea level was 125±5 m lower than the present day, equivalent to a land-based ice volume of (4.6–4.9)×107 km3. Evidence for a non-uniform rise in eustatic sea level from the {LGM} to the end of the deglaciation is examined. The initial rate of rise from ca. 21 to 17 ka was relatively slow with an average rate of ca. 6 m ka−1, followed by an average rate of ca. 10 m ka−1 for the next 10 ka. Significant departures from these average rates may have occurred at the time of the Younger Dryas and possibly also around 14 ka. Most of the decay of the large ice sheets was completed by 7 ka, but 3–5 m of water has been added to the oceans since that time.},

	abstract = {During the Anthropocene, regulating river discharge by high dams may have met the need for water demands in river basins, but resulted in carrying less freshwater and sediment to the sea, inducing land degradation and shoreline retreat in worldwide mega-river deltas. In land-ocean interaction, tide response to water discharge changes plays an important role and is crucial for the river-laden sediment transfer and dispersal, affecting both nearshore and estuarine deposits. The Yellow River Delta ({YRD}), which is under an increasing pressure of the new discharge regime of the Yellow River, has undergone drastic changes in terms of sediment dynamics and morphologic evolution. To gain a better understanding of the overall fluvial and marine hydrodynamics and morphodynamic processes in the {YRD}, in this study, a full-scale numerical model is built to investigate the interaction and impacts of changing environmental forcing and dynamics on flow and sediment transport in the estuary of {YRD} and its adjacent coasts. The results show that the river discharge strongly affects the tidal dynamics and morphology of the delta, particularly in the close vicinity of the outlet and the intertidal zone. Tidal constituents M2 and K1, which are the most significant ones in the {YRD}, are found to be noticeably affected with a decreasing trend when the river discharge increases. The model results also indicate that river discharge affects the location and intensity of the shear front that occurs in the nearshore areas of the {YRD}. Increasing the river discharge can induce a seaward movement of the shear front, reduce its width and concentrate its shear intensity. It is found that the reverse of the flow direction at each side of the shear front and strong longshore tidal current can act as a barrier for the sediment dispersal process by keeping suspended sediment in the inner zone, thus to form a particular sediment deposition zone and the depo-center.},

	abstract = {At a global scale, delta morphologies are subject to rapid change as a result of direct and indirect effects of human activity. This jeopardizes the ecosystem services of deltas, including protection against flood hazards, facilitation of navigation, and biodiversity. Direct manifestations of delta morphological instability include river bank failure, which may lead to avulsion, persistent channel incision or aggregation, and a change of the sedimentary regime to hyperturbid conditions. Notwithstanding the in-depth knowledge developed over the past decades about those topics, existing understanding is fragmented, and the predictive capacity of morphodynamic models is limited. The advancement of potential resilience analysis tools may proceed from improved models, continuous observations, and the application of novel analysis techniques. Progress will benefit from synergy between approaches. Empirical and numerical models are built using field observations, and, in turn, model simulations can inform observationists about where to measure. Information theory offers a systematic approach to test the realism of alternative model concepts. Once the key mechanism responsible for a morphodynamic instability phenomenon is understood, concepts from dynamic system theory can be employed to develop early warning indicators. In the development of reliable tools to design resilient deltas, one of the first challenges is to close the sediment balance at multiple scales, such that morphodynamic model predictions match with fully independent measurements. Such a high ambition level is rarely adopted and is urgently needed to address the ongoing global changes causing sea level rise and reduced sediment input by reservoir building.},

	abstract = {We present a novel quantitative test of a 50-year-old hypothesis which asserts that river delta morphology is determined by the balance between river and marine influence. We define three metrics to capture the first-order morphology of deltas (shoreline roughness, number of distributary channel mouths, and presence/absence of spits), and use a recently developed sediment flux framework to quantify the river-marine influence. Through analysis of simulated and field deltas we quantitatively demonstrate the relationship between sediment flux balance and delta morphology and show that the flux balance accounts for at least 35\% of the variance in the number of distributary channel mouths and 42\% of the variance in the shoreline roughness for real-world and simulated deltas. We identify a tipping point in the flux balance where wave influence halts distributary channel formation and show how this explains morphological transitions in real world deltas.},

	abstract = {As the tidal wave propagates into an estuary, the tidally averaged water level tends to rise in landward direction due to the density difference between saline and fresh water and the asymmetry of the friction. The effect of friction on the residual slope is even more remarkable when accounting for fresh water discharge. In this study, we investigate the inﬂuence of river discharge on tidal wave propagation in the Yangtze estuary with speciﬁc attention to residual water level slope. This is done by using a one-dimensional analytical model for tidal hydrodynamics accounting for the residual water level. We demonstrate the importance of the residual slope on tidal dynamics and use it to improve the prediction of the tidal propagation in estuaries (i.e. tidal damping, velocity amplitude, wave celerity and phase lag), especially when the inﬂuence of river discharge is signiﬁcant. Finally, we develop a new inverse analytical approach for estimating fresh water discharge on the basis of tidal water level observations along the estuary, which can be used as a tool to obtain information on the river discharge that is otherwise difﬁcult to measure in the tidal region.},

	shorttitle = {River Mouth Hydrodynamics},
	abstract = {The hydrodynamics of river mouths are the result of a complex interaction between river flow, tidal conditions, and outlet geometry. This complex interaction of factors shapes the jet that flows onto the continental shelf and influences the dynamics of these areas. This work analyses the influence of idealized but realistic outlet geometries under steady and unsteady hydrodynamic conditions on the jet structure. The analysis is carried out using a numerical model which is validated by comparison with the classical jet theory for highly simplified conditions where this theory applies. The results show that both the outlet geometry and the transient hydrodynamic conditions have a significant influence on the jet structure and evolution along the nearshore. For constant river discharge and water level conditions, the results indicate that the nearshore profile plays a key role in determining the expansion or contraction of the jet. The momentum balance shows that the jet behavior is related to the momentum transport and the barotropic terms. In cases where the river discharge and tidal conditions are transient, the jet alternates between a structure with two velocity maxima at the edges or a single peak in the center during the tidal cycle depending on the phase lag between the tidal conditions and the river hydrograph. These two different jet structures play an important role in the morphodynamic evolution of the river mouths and bar development, favoring in some cases the formation of lateral levees parallel to the channel walls.},
