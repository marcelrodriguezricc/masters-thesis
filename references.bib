	abstract = {The shallow waters of the nearshore ocean are popular, dynamic, and often hostile. Prediction in this domain is usually limited less by our understanding of the physics or by the power of our models than by the availability of input data, such as bathymetry and wave conditions. It is a challenge for traditional in situ instruments to provide these inputs with the appropriate temporal or spatial density or at reasonable logistical or ﬁnancial costs. Remote sensing provides an attractive alternative. We discuss the range of different sensors that are available and the differing physical manifestations of their interactions with the ocean surface. We then present existing algorithms by which the most important geophysical variables can be estimated from remote sensing measurements. Future directions and opportunities will depend on expected developments in sensors and platforms and on improving processing algorithms, including data assimilation formalisms.},

	abstract = {Long-term datasets documenting the evolution of coastal forms and processes, through the provision of recurring beach as well as shoreface morphological observations and accompanying time-series of environmental controls, remain difficult to collect and are rarely made available. However, they are increasingly needed to further our understanding of coastal change and to improve the models that will help planning what our future coast will be. This data descriptor presents the results of topographic and bathymetric surveys at Porsmilin, a macrotidal embayed beach situated in Brittany, northwest France. The Porsmilin beach survey program was launched in January 2003 by the Institut Universitaire Européen de la Mer (IUEM/Univ. Brest) and is continuing today in the framework of the French coastal observation service SNO-DYNALIT. The dataset contains over 16 years of monthly beach profile surveys and a large collection of repeated high-resolution subtidal and subaerial digital elevation models (DEMs). The dataset is accompanied by time-series of inshore waves and water levels, and enriched metadata, that will facilitate its future reuse in coastal research.},

	abstract = {Climate change is resulting in global changes to sea level and wave climates, which in many locations significantly increase the probability of erosion, flooding and damage to coastal infrastructure and ecosystems. Therefore, there is a pressing societal need to be able to forecast the morphological evolution of our coastlines over a broad range of timescales, spanning days-to-decades, facilitating more focused, appropriate and cost-effective management interventions and data-informed planning to support the development of coastal environments. A wide range of modelling approaches have been used with varying degrees of success to assess both the detailed morphological evolution and/or simplified indicators of coastal erosion/accretion. This paper presents an overview of these modelling approaches, covering the full range of the complexity spectrum and summarising the advantages and disadvantages of each method. A focus is given to reduced-complexity modelling approaches, including models based on equilibrium concepts, which have emerged as a particularly promising methodology for the prediction of coastal change over multi-decadal timescales. The advantages of stable, computationally-efficient, reduced-complexity models must be balanced against the requirement for good generality and skill in diverse and complex coastal settings. Significant obstacles are also identified, limiting the generic application of models at regional and global scales. Challenges include the accurate long-term prediction of model forcing time-series in a changing climate, and accounting for processes that can largely be ignored in the shorter term but increase in importance in the long term. Further complications include coastal complexities, such as the accurate assessment of the impacts of headland bypassing. Additional complexities include complex structures and geology, mixed grain size, limited sediment supply, sources and sinks. It is concluded that with present computational resources, data availability limitations and process knowledge gaps, reduced-complexity modelling approaches currently offer the most promising solution to modelling shoreline evolution on daily-to-decadal timescales.},

	abstract = {This contribution describes the development, calibration and verification of a 1-D behaviour-orientated shoreline prediction model. The model primarily encapsulates shoreline displacement forced by wave-driven cross-shore sediment transport. Hysteresis effects are shown to be important and are included in the model, whereby present shoreline change is influenced by past hydro-/morpho-dynamic conditions. The potential magnitude of shoreline change increases with incident wave power and the degree of disequilibrium. The latter disequilibrium term (Ωeq−Ω) is expressed in terms of the time-evolving equilibrium (Ωeq) and instantaneous (Ω) dimensionless fall velocities and dictates the direction of shoreline movement. Following Wright et al. (1985) the equilibrium fall velocity is defined as a function of the weighted antecedent conditions and is a proxy for the evolving beach state. The decay rate of the weighting function used to compute Ωeq is a model free parameter determined by calibration against measured data, which physically reflects the degree of observed ‘memory’ of the system. The decay in amplitude of this weighting function with time is controlled by a ‘memory decay’ term (ϕ), where the weighting reaches 10\%, 1\% and 0.1\% at ϕ, 2ϕ and 3ϕ days prior to the current calculation time. The model is applied to two multi-year (6+ years) data sets incorporating hourly wave and weekly shoreline measurements, from two contrasting energetic sites in SE Australia. The first is the relatively dissipative, straight Gold Coast (QLD) and the second is a more intermediate embayed beach at Narrabeen (NSW). The model shows significant skill at hindcasting shoreline change at both sites, predicting approximately 60\% of the total shoreline variability. The Gold Coast shoreline is dominated by a strong seasonal signal. Conversely, at the Narrabeen embayment, shoreline variability (and morphology) is more dynamic, responding at storm frequency. Evidence suggests that there is a strong coherence between the shoreline position and morphodynamic state and that both have response times characterised by ϕ. It is hypothesised that optimised ϕ values in the shoreline model physically relate to the efficiency of sediment exchanges between the shoreface and offshore bars and the prevalence of one- or two-dimensional horizontal circulation. The general success of this new shoreline model for hindcasting the observed shoreline behaviour at two distinctly different open-coast sites suggests that this approach may be suitable for broader application.},

The measured longshore current variations at tidal frequency are the same order of magnitude as the mean longshore current variations for moderate wave height conditions, indicating that the tide is a dominant mechanism associated with longshore current variability. Simulations of the magnitude and phase of the longshore current variability with tide elevation using the model by Thornton and Guza (1986) are used to explain observations. The measured tidal elevation and longshore current are in phase in the inner surf zone and out of phase in the outer surf zone as predicted by the model, verifying the hypothesis.},

	abstract = {A new class of nearshore waves based on the shear instability of a steady longshore current is discussed. The dynamics depend on the conservation of potential vorticity but with the background vorticity field, traditionally the role of Coriolis in larger scale flows, supplied by the shear structure of the longshore current. The resulting vorticity waves are longshore-progressive with celerities roughly equal to V0/3, where V0 is the peak longshore current velocity. A natural frequency scaling for the problem is fs, the shear of the seaward face of the longshore current. While the instability can span a range of frequencies and wavenumbers, a representative frequency is given by 0.07fs, typically in the range of 10−3–10−2 Hz (called the Far Infragravity, or FIG, band because frequencies are just below those of the infragravity band). Wavelengths are of the order of 2x0, where x0 is the width of the longshore current. Growth is exponential with an e-folding time that is typically half of a wave period. Field data, presented in the companion paper [Oltman-Shay et al., this issue], demonstrate the presence of energetic motions from a natural beach whose behavior matches the theory in many aspects. Results from the model suggest that shear instability will be more important on barred, rather than monotonic beach profiles, a result of the stronger shears expected over the bar crest. Since vorticity waves will probably have a profound effect on cross-shore mixing as well as longshore current dissipation, we expect the dynamics of barred and monotonic beaches to show fundamental differences.},

Root-mean-square wave heights, Hrms, are found across the surf zone by numerical iteration, and compare well with field data acquired on both barred and near-planar beaches. The model has two free parameters, σ, the mean angle to vertical of the wave/roller interface roughly representing the type of breaker, and γ, a measure of breaking wave saturation equal to the ratio of Hrms to local depth. Optimal values of both parameters are chosen by model fitting, and show the model to be insensitive to σ. Although the model is sensitive to the choice of γ, values are consistent with field data. The surface roller model behaves similarly to the bore dissipation model of Thornton and Guza for a particular parameter choice, and is used to decrease model dependence to one input parameter, γ.},

	abstract = {The data for the spectrums of fully developed seas obtained by Moskowitz [1964] for wind speeds from 20 to 40 knots (10.29 to 20.58 m/sec), are used to test the similarity hypothesis and the idea proposed by Kitaigorodskii [1961] that, when plotted in a certain dimensionless way, the power spectrums for all fully developed seas should be of the same shape. Over the important range of frequencies that define the total variance of the spectrum within a few per cent, the transformed plots yield a nondimensional spectral form that is nearly the same over this entire range of wind speeds within the present accuracies of the data. However, since slight variations of the wind speed have large effects on the location of this nondimensional spectral form, inaccuracies in the determination of the wind speed at sea allow for some latitude in the final choice of the form of the spectrum. Also, since the winds used to obtain the nondimensional form were measured at a height greater than 10 meters, the problem of relating the spectral form to a standard anemometer height arises. The variability introduced by this factor needs to be considered. The results, when errors in the wind speed, the sampling variability of the data, and the anemometer heights are considered, suggest a spectral form that is a compromise between the various proposed spectrums and that has features similar to many of them. A spectral form is recommended for tentative application to the problem of wave forecasting by spectral techniques. Improved wind speed measurements (taken at several elevations and averaged over longer time intervals) and better wave data (taken for longer time intervals and analyzed so as to better fit the procedures) are needed so that the form of the spectrums of fully developed wind seas and seas limited by either fetch or duration can be determined with even greater precision.},

This has been quantified for the period since the Last Glacial Maximum by correcting observed sea-level change for the glacio-hydro-isostatic contributions using realistic ice distribution and earth models. During the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) the eustatic sea level was 125±5 m lower than the present day, equivalent to a land-based ice volume of (4.6–4.9)×107 km3. Evidence for a non-uniform rise in eustatic sea level from the LGM to the end of the deglaciation is examined. The initial rate of rise from ca. 21 to 17 ka was relatively slow with an average rate of ca. 6 m ka−1, followed by an average rate of ca. 10 m ka−1 for the next 10 ka. Significant departures from these average rates may have occurred at the time of the Younger Dryas and possibly also around 14 ka. Most of the decay of the large ice sheets was completed by 7 ka, but 3–5 m of water has been added to the oceans since that time.},

	abstract = {During the Anthropocene, regulating river discharge by high dams may have met the need for water demands in river basins, but resulted in carrying less freshwater and sediment to the sea, inducing land degradation and shoreline retreat in worldwide mega-river deltas. In land-ocean interaction, tide response to water discharge changes plays an important role and is crucial for the river-laden sediment transfer and dispersal, affecting both nearshore and estuarine deposits. The Yellow River Delta (YRD), which is under an increasing pressure of the new discharge regime of the Yellow River, has undergone drastic changes in terms of sediment dynamics and morphologic evolution. To gain a better understanding of the overall fluvial and marine hydrodynamics and morphodynamic processes in the YRD, in this study, a full-scale numerical model is built to investigate the interaction and impacts of changing environmental forcing and dynamics on flow and sediment transport in the estuary of YRD and its adjacent coasts. The results show that the river discharge strongly affects the tidal dynamics and morphology of the delta, particularly in the close vicinity of the outlet and the intertidal zone. Tidal constituents M2 and K1, which are the most significant ones in the YRD, are found to be noticeably affected with a decreasing trend when the river discharge increases. The model results also indicate that river discharge affects the location and intensity of the shear front that occurs in the nearshore areas of the YRD. Increasing the river discharge can induce a seaward movement of the shear front, reduce its width and concentrate its shear intensity. It is found that the reverse of the flow direction at each side of the shear front and strong longshore tidal current can act as a barrier for the sediment dispersal process by keeping suspended sediment in the inner zone, thus to form a particular sediment deposition zone and the depo-center.},

	abstract = {At a global scale, delta morphologies are subject to rapid change as a result of direct and indirect effects of human activity. This jeopardizes the ecosystem services of deltas, including protection against flood hazards, facilitation of navigation, and biodiversity. Direct manifestations of delta morphological instability include river bank failure, which may lead to avulsion, persistent channel incision or aggregation, and a change of the sedimentary regime to hyperturbid conditions. Notwithstanding the in-depth knowledge developed over the past decades about those topics, existing understanding is fragmented, and the predictive capacity of morphodynamic models is limited. The advancement of potential resilience analysis tools may proceed from improved models, continuous observations, and the application of novel analysis techniques. Progress will benefit from synergy between approaches. Empirical and numerical models are built using field observations, and, in turn, model simulations can inform observationists about where to measure. Information theory offers a systematic approach to test the realism of alternative model concepts. Once the key mechanism responsible for a morphodynamic instability phenomenon is understood, concepts from dynamic system theory can be employed to develop early warning indicators. In the development of reliable tools to design resilient deltas, one of the first challenges is to close the sediment balance at multiple scales, such that morphodynamic model predictions match with fully independent measurements. Such a high ambition level is rarely adopted and is urgently needed to address the ongoing global changes causing sea level rise and reduced sediment input by reservoir building.},

We define three metrics to capture the first-order morphology of deltas (shoreline roughness, number of distributary channel mouths, and presence/absence of spits), and use a recently developed sediment flux framework to quantify the river-marine influence. Through analysis of simulated and field deltas we quantitatively demonstrate the relationship between sediment flux balance and delta morphology and show that the flux balance accounts for at least 35\% of the variance in the number of distributary channel mouths and 42\% of the variance in the shoreline roughness for real-world and simulated deltas. We identify a tipping point in the flux balance where wave influence halts distributary channel formation and show how this explains morphological transitions in real world deltas.},

The effect of friction on the residual slope is even more remarkable when accounting for fresh water discharge. In this study, we investigate the inﬂuence of river discharge on tidal wave propagation in the Yangtze estuary with speciﬁc attention to residual water level slope. This is done by using a one-dimensional analytical model for tidal hydrodynamics accounting for the residual water level. We demonstrate the importance of the residual slope on tidal dynamics and use it to improve the prediction of the tidal propagation in estuaries (i.e. tidal damping, velocity amplitude, wave celerity and phase lag), especially when the inﬂuence of river discharge is signiﬁcant. Finally, we develop a new inverse analytical approach for estimating fresh water discharge on the basis of tidal water level observations along the estuary, which can be used as a tool to obtain information on the river discharge that is otherwise difﬁcult to measure in the tidal region.},

	abstract = {The hydrodynamics of river mouths are the result of a complex interaction between river flow, tidal conditions, and outlet geometry. This complex interaction of factors shapes the jet that flows onto the continental shelf and influences the dynamics of these areas. This work analyses the influence of idealized but realistic outlet geometries under steady and unsteady hydrodynamic conditions on the jet structure. The analysis is carried out using a numerical model which is validated by comparison with the classical jet theory for highly simplified conditions where this theory applies. The results show that both the outlet geometry and the transient hydrodynamic conditions have a significant influence on the jet structure and evolution along the nearshore. For constant river discharge and water level conditions, the results indicate that the nearshore profile plays a key role in determining the expansion or contraction of the jet. The momentum balance shows that the jet behavior is related to the momentum transport and the barotropic terms. In cases where the river discharge and tidal conditions are transient, the jet alternates between a structure with two velocity maxima at the edges or a single peak in the center during the tidal cycle depending on the phase lag between the tidal conditions and the river hydrograph. These two different jet structures play an important role in the morphodynamic evolution of the river mouths and bar development, favoring in some cases the formation of lateral levees parallel to the channel walls.},

Apparently, integrated watershed management is emerging as an approach for the sustained development and management of natural resources. The integral enactment of different environmental frameworks, strategies and policies could positively impact watershed- based developmental approaches. Sediment which is brought through water erosion can hamper the proper functioning of waterways as well as the quality of water in dams. Knowhow on soil erosion and the sedimentation process is among the requisites that need to be considered for the control of sedimentation. Other elements like climate, edaphic factors, land management, topography, and land cover, etc. will also determine the sedimentation process. Integrated Watershed Management approach is a worthy approach to manage the ecological, social and economic watershed development challenges in countries like Ethiopia. Thus, this article is intended to assess watershed characteristics that will help to explore the possibilities of reducing sedimentation and its related effects.},

	abstract = {A submerged, low-relief nearshore berm was constructed in the Pacific Ocean near the mouth of the Columbia River, USA, using 216,000 m3 of sediment dredged from the adjacent navigation channel. The material dredged from the navigation channel was placed on the northern flank of the ebb-tidal delta in water depths between 12 and 15 m and created a distinct feature that could be tracked over time. Field measurements and numerical modeling were used to evaluate the transport pathways, time scales, and physical processes responsible for dispersal of the berm and evaluate the suitability of the location for operational placement of dredged material to enhance the sediment supply to eroding beaches onshore of the placement site. Repeated multibeam bathymetric surveys characterized the initial berm morphology and dispersion of the berm between September 22, 2020, and March 10, 2021. During this time, the volume of sediment within the berm decreased by about 40\%to 127,000 m3, the maximum height decreased by almost 60\%, and the center of the deposit shifted onshore over 200 m. Observations of berm morphology were compared with predictions from a three-dimensional hydrodynamic and sediment transport model application to refine poorly constrained model input parameters including sediment transport coefficients, bed schematization, and grain size. The calibrated sediment transport model was used to predict the amount, timing, and direction of transport outside of the observed survey area. Model simulations predicted that tidal currents were weak in the vicinity of the berm and wave processes including enhanced bottom stresses and asymmetric bottom orbital velocities resulted in dominant onshore movement of sediment from the berm toward the coastline. Roughly 50\% of the berm volume was predicted to disperse away from the initial placement site during the 169 day hindcast. Between 9 and 17\% of the initial volume of the berm was predicted to accumulate along the shoreface of a shoreline reach experiencing chronic erosion directly onshore of the placement site. Scenarios exploring alternate placement locations suggested that the berm was relatively effective in enhancing the sediment supply along the eroding coastline north of the inlet. The transferable monitoring and modeling framework developed in this study can be used to inform implementation of strategic nearshore placements and regional sediment management in complex, high-energy coastal environments elsewhere.},

Previous observations of tidal intrusion fronts describe a V-shaped planform, with the apex of the V pointing into the estuary, however the significance of this structure has not been previously explained. Observations near the mouth of the James River estuary during the flood tide reveal the development of a quasi-steady, V-shaped front. Considering a reference frame oriented normal to the front, the velocity and density structure are consistent with gravity-current dynamics, but the oblique orientation of the front relative to the impinging flow indicates strong, along-front shear, which results from vorticity produced by flow separation at the lateral boundaries as well as topographic torque from upstream. The combination of convergence and along-front shear leads to enhanced mixing, as revealed by acoustic backscatter images of shear instability and persistent subcritical gradient Richardson number in the frontal zone. Oblique fronts such as this tidal intrusion front are common features of estuaries, and they play an important role in vertical exchange due to subduction and mixing of surface water.},

Unlike the previous fragmented approach to beach studies, the morphodynamic approach provided a time–space framework within which all beach systems could be located at timescales from the instantaneous to the Quaternary, and spatially across all coastal environments. Equally important was the interdependence of processes and morphological response, so that beach systems could be studied in a state of dynamic equilibrium with the prevailing processes and boundary conditions. This approach enabled the full spectrum of beach systems and types to be identiﬁed and characterized and is utilized to examine beach response at scales from the instantaneous, to event, to long term. This chapter covers the development of the morphodynamic approach; its application within and across the beach environment; the present level of understanding; and areas requiring more research.},

	abstract = {The spatial and temporal variability of nearshore sand bar morphology is quantified using a unique data set spanning 2 years. The data consist of daily time exposure images of incident wave breaking on an open coast sandy beach which may be used to infer bar morphology (Lippmann and Holman, 1989). The morphology in each image is classified into an eight state morphologic scheme in which bars are uniquely defined by four independent criteria. The most frequently observed morphologies are the longshore‐periodic (rhythmic) bars, observed in 68\% of the data. Linear bars occur under highest wave conditions
              
              and are unstable (mean residence time ≈ 2 days). Shore‐attached rhythmic bars are the most stable (mean residence time ≈ 11 days) and generally form 5–16 days following peak wave events. Non‐rhythmic, three‐dimensional bars are very transient (mean residence time ≈ 3 days). Eighty‐seven percent of transitions to lower bar types (defined in text) occurred one state at a time, supporting our selection of the ordering of states, and suggesting the suitability of a sequential morphology model. Transitions to higher states occurred under rising wave energy and were evenly spread among the possible higher states, with more substantial changes in morphology resulting from larger wave increases. This suggests that up‐state, erosional transitions (based on offshore bar migration) are better described by an equilibrium model where response is better correlated with incident wave energy than with preceding morphological state. Time exposure images were also digitized to yield quantitative estimates of bar crest location as a function of longshore distance. Principal component analysis was used to decompose bar position into two‐dimensional (linear) and three‐dimensional (longshore variable) components. Cross‐shore (linear) bar position ranges ±50 m about the 2‐year mean (27 m standard deviation) and dominates bar variability (74.6\%). Three‐dimensional bar structure accounts for ∼14\% of the variance (12 m standard deviation). Changes in incident wave height precede cross‐shore bar migration by less than 1 day. Changes in longshore variability are inversely correlated to changing wave conditions, with bar morphology becoming linear rapidly during storms (on time scales of less than 1 day). Evolution to significantly three‐dimensional structure typically occurs over 5–7 days following peak wave events.},

	abstract = {O'Hare, T.J. and Huntley, D.A., 1994. Bar formation due to wave groups and associated long waves. Mar. Geol., 116: 313-325. Field observations reveal that waves propagating onto a beach from deeper water have a grouped structure. Associated with this pattern of alternating high and low waves is a long wave forced by radiation stress variations due to the changing short wave height. As the wave groups propagate onshore, the relationship between the variation in the short wave height and the long wave motion is complicated by breaking of the short waves, reflection of the long wave and the generation of a free long wave by time variation of the breakpoint position. Nevertheless, there may still be a fixed phase relation between the short-wave envelope and the long wave motion at any particular location, resulting in a net transport of sediment over the timescale of the short wave groups. This transport arises from sediment grains mobilised by short waves and moved by the long wave motion. Model predictions of wave group propagation onto a beach and the associated long wave motions are presented which suggest that sediment transport due to short-wave/long-wave coupling may result in the formation of a bar within the inner surf-zone and the possibility of additional bars further offshore, outside the surf-zone. This mechanism for bar formation may provide a new framework for understanding bar morphodynamics.},

	abstract = {Beach scarps are nearly vertical seaward facing sandy cliffs within the cross-shore beach profile. These features are often associated with eroding (nourished) coastlines and can reach heights of O(2–3 m). An analysis of a six-year dataset of beach scarp presence at the nourished Sand Engine beach shows that the formation of beach scarps at the nourishment is linked to mildly erosive (summer storm) conditions, whereas destruction is often related to extremely erosive (winter storm) conditions. Additional experiments were carried out showing the formation, migration, and destruction of scarps from artificially constructed mounds with linear slopes. The field experiments show that steep initial slopes are more susceptible to beach scarp formation. Video observations at these experiments show that the scarp toe level, where the vertical slope meets the gently sloping beach, is related to the high wave runup events. The commonly used 2\% exceedance wave runup estimates can therefore be used to predict the final elevation of the scarp toe. The strong connection of maximum runup elevation with the scarp toe elevation provides a direct relation between the final scarp height through nourishment platform height and hydrodynamic conditions. High platform nourishments will promote the formation of beach scarps and steep initial profiles increase the speed at which scarps form. This study suggests that by adjusting the design of beach nourishments, beach scarp formation and persistency can be limited by regulating the natural destruction of these features.},

	abstract = {The Younghusband Peninsula coastal barrier extends ∼190 km and is predominantly comprised of a mix of active, semi-stabilised and stabilised (relict) transgressive and parabolic dunefields. Wave driven shoreline erosion has triggered the rapid development of a transgressive dunefield along a portion the peninsula. This study focuses on a ∼2 km region with the highest regional erosion rates ({\textgreater} −2.0 m/year since 1988), and which has experienced rapid destabilisation and subsequent landward translation of the dunefield. Aerial LIDAR derived datasets of the barrier system from 2008 and 2018 and eight drone photogrammetry surveys between August 2020 and April 2022 are used to compare the rates of change across the beach-dune system. The net and intra-survey changes are used to show the short- to medium-term system response and illustrate the relationship of sediment dynamics to the developing morphology and structure of the dunefield. Shoreline change rates (m/yr) are sourced from the Digital Earth Australia coastlines dataset which provides annual rates for continental Australia from a Landsat time series (1988–2021). When the rate of shoreline change is segmented from the total dataset to the study time-period (2008–2021), the average resulting rates show an increase from −2.2 m/yr to −3.3 m/yr, respectively. This coincides with a landward advance rate of {\textgreater}10 m/yr from 2008 of the dunefield edge, with the fastest eroding dune toes corresponding to regions with the highest rate of dunefield translation and transgression. Net volumetric totals and their ratios of gain to loss of sediments show that significant sediment is lost to offshore during the retrogradation of the dunefield as only a fraction of the stoss slope sediment is transferred landwards. All regions of the dunefield exhibit a net loss of sediments but the high-temporal resolution shows that the magnitude of 3D changes varies through time. An adapted model of erosional stoss slope evolution and dunefield development is advanced and a temporal model of transgressive dunefield evolution is synthesised.},

	abstract = {Analyses of morphological and hydrodynamic data from two macrotidal beaches (mean spring ranges respectively 5.6 and 6.4 m) with intertidal bars and troughs were carried out in order to detect and explain the relationship between tides and bar morphological attributes (bar crest height and location) and morphological change. The following four aspects are treated in the paper: (1) tidal levels, vertical tidal translation rates and bar morphology, (2) tidal range and morphological relaxation, (3) the neap–spring tidal variation, and (4) tide-generated longshore currents. Bar distribution and bar heights across the profile are not related in a straightforward manner to tidal levels and expected vertical tidal translation rates at these levels, because the wave process domains involved in bar formation and bar morphological change are strongly modulated by wave energy, by tidemodulated water levels which vary with the neap–spring cycle, and by the beach morphology. The variability of these conditions may explain the large variability of bar–trough beach morphology. The relatively large tidal ranges and rapidly shifting wave domains across the profile imply long periods of non-exposure of the bars to wave processes during each semi-diurnal tidal cycle, and this tide-generated effect reduces the scope for prolonged wave reworking while contributing to enhancing the long relaxation times and morphological feedback which minimise change on these beaches. The effects of the neap–spring tidal range variation on wave activity on these beaches are subordinate to those due to the random wave energy regime, but this neap–spring variation appears to influence the morphologically important intertidal drainage channels associated with bar–trough topography. Although longshore tidal currents are relatively strong on these beaches, digital elevation models show no significant longshore bar and tidal channel migration over time, due to the absence of sustained strong wind conditions, which considerably reinforce such longshore tidal currents, and which therefore are the dominant control on longshore processes on these beaches. It is also tentatively suggested that there is no established relationship between tidal range and the number of intertidal bars on these beaches.},

	abstract = {Climate change is exacerbating shoreline erosion and flooding, posing significant risks to coastal communities. Although traditional coastal defenses such as seawalls, dykes, and breakwaters offer protection from these hazards, their high environmental and economic costs are driving interest in cost-competitive nature-based solutions. Coral reef restoration is a nature-based solution that may be particularly apt to mitigate tropical coastal flooding and shoreline erosion while providing benefits to local tourism, fisheries, and nature. However, the novelty of this field requires studies demonstrating the benefits of reefs for coastal protection. While the flood protection benefits of reefs have been well-documented, their effects on shoreline erosion are comparatively less understood. Here, we investigate the effects of coral reefs on shoreline erosion by comparing tropical beach responses at short and long timescales, as well as identifying important reef structural features influencing coastal erosion rates. Our analyses leveraged two key datasets created in this study: the first derived from a literature review on short-term shoreline erosion due to storm events, and another compiling {\textgreater}80 years of long-term erosion rates, bathymetry, habitat, and wave energy for the Hawaiian Islands of Kauaʻi, Oʻahu, and Maui. Our analyses reveal three key findings regarding the effects of reefs on shoreline erosion. Firstly, we find evidence for the role of reefs in mitigating shoreline erosion during storm events, with coral reef-protected beaches experiencing 97 \% less beach volume loss than unprotected beaches. Secondly, a linear regression analysis demonstrates that coral reef structure and wave energy are important predictors of long-term shoreline erosion rates, explaining 34 \% of the variation across the Hawaiian Islands. Consistent with prior research, we find beaches protected by coral reefs with shallow reef crests, wide reef flats, calmer offshore conditions, and positioned farther from the shore exhibit lower erosion rates than others. Finally, when comparing historical erosion rates of protected and unprotected beaches in Hawai'i, we find a seemingly incongruous pattern where coral reef-protected beaches eroded up to 2x faster than beaches without reefs. While the cause of the enhanced erosion is yet to be fully understood, a combination of coral reef structural degradation and sea-level rise is likely shifting the equilibrium profiles of reef-protected beaches inshore. These results emphasize the role of coral reefs in reducing coastal erosion during storm events while revealing contrasting erosion patterns over long timescales. Future studies would ideally broaden the scope to include various regions, utilize advanced sediment transport models, and undertake field experiments to deepen our understanding of coral reef-coupled shoreline dynamics.},

These hazards put coastal communities at heightened risk, which may increase with habitat loss. Here we analyse globally the role and cost effectiveness of coral reefs in risk reduction. Meta-analyses reveal that coral reefs provide substantial protection against natural hazards by reducing wave energy by an average of 97\%. Reef crests alone dissipate most of this energy (86\%). There are 100 million or more people who may receive risk reduction benefits from reefs or bear hazard mitigation and adaptation costs if reefs are degraded. We show that coral reefs can provide comparable wave attenuation benefits to artificial defences such as breakwaters, and reef defences can be enhanced cost effectively. Reefs face growing threats yet there is opportunity to guide adaptation and hazard mitigation investments towards reef restoration to strengthen this first line of coastal defence.},

Data was obtained for various wave conditions and water levels. A nonlinearity parameter, Fco = g1.25Ho0.5T2.5/hc1.75, based upon one proposed by Swart and Loubser (1979), is proposed as a suitable parameter for classifying wave transformation regimes on this reef. In particular, when Fco {\textgreater} 150, waves plunge on the reef edge and the amount of wave energy reaching a shore or structure is small ⩽ 16\%. When Fin co ⩽ 100, waves spill on the reef-top but the greater part of their energy is transmitted over the reef-top. The maximum values of the wave height to water depth ratio on the reef-top were found to be consistent with Nelson's analyses for laboratory and field data which indicate that the maximum stable wave height to depth ratio H/d on a horizontal bottom never exceeds 0.55 for shallow water waves (Fc {\textgreater} 500). The experimental data confirms that the maximum value of H/d decreases when Fc decreases but that it also increases when the bottom slope increases.},

Now, having collected earth observation data for well over four decades since the 1972 launch of Landsat-1, the Landsat program is increasingly complex and vibrant. Critical programmatic elements are ensuring the continuity of high quality measurements for scientific and operational investigations, including ground systems, acquisition planning, data archiving and management, and provision of analysis ready data products. Free and open access to archival and new imagery has resulted in a myriad of innovative applications and novel scientific insights. The planning of future compatible satellites in the Landsat series, which maintain continuity while incorporating technological advancements, has resulted in an increased operational use of Landsat data. Governments and international agencies, among others, can now build an expectation of Landsat data into a given operational data stream. International programs and conventions (e.g., deforestation monitoring, climate change mitigation) are empowered by access to systematically collected and calibrated data with expected future continuity further contributing to the existing multi-decadal record. The increased breadth and depth of Landsat science and applications have accelerated following the launch of Landsat-8, with significant improvements in data quality. Herein, we describe the programmatic developments and institutional context for the Landsat program and the unique ability of Landsat to meet the needs of national and international programs. We then present the key trends in Landsat science that underpin many of the recent scientific and application developments and follow-up with more detailed thematically organized summaries. The historical context offered by archival imagery combined with new imagery allows for the development of time series algorithms that can produce information on trends and dynamics. Landsat-8 has figured prominently in these recent developments, as has the improved understanding and calibration of historical data. Following the communication of the state of Landsat science, an outlook for future launches and envisioned programmatic developments are presented. Increased linkages between satellite programs are also made possible through an expectation of future mission continuity, such as developing a virtual constellation with Sentinel-2. Successful science and applications developments create a positive feedback loop—justifying and encouraging current and future programmatic support for Landsat.},

Early remote sensing was predominantly passive, i.e. it depends upon the sun for energy. Till the last decade, optical imaging is mainly used in remote sensing works. Over the time, significant innovations and improvements have been made in the active remote sensing which resulted in the form of sophisticated imaging techniques like Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) and Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR). These advancements promoted the use of multi-sensor and multi-source data in remote sensing projects. This highlights the need to review these imaging techniques. Therefore, this review work is carried out. In this review, different imaging techniques are discussed and compared. Optical, SAR and LiDAR techniques are first summarized and then they are compared on the basis of technical specification and working. Finally, an in-depth assessment is made on the applicability of these imaging techniques in different fields.},

	abstract = {Applications of Earth-observational remote sensing are rapidly increasing over urban areas. The latest regime shift from conventional urban development to smart-city development has triggered a rise in smart innovative technologies to complement spatial and temporal information in new urban design models. Remote sensing-based Earth-observations provide critical information to close the gaps between real and virtual models of urban developments. Remote sensing, itself, has rapidly evolved since the launch of the first Earth-observation satellite, Landsat, in 1972. Technological advancements over the years have gradually improved the ground resolution of satellite images, from 80 m in the 1970s to 0.3 m in the 2020s. Apart from the ground resolution, improvements have been made in many other aspects of satellite remote sensing. Also, the method and techniques of information extraction have advanced. However, to understand the latest developments and scope of information extraction, it is important to understand background information and major techniques of image processing. This chapter briefly describes the history of optical remote sensing, the basic operation of satellite image processing, advanced methods of object extraction for modern urban designs, various applications of remote sensing in urban or peri-urban settings, and future satellite missions and directions of urban remote sensing.},

	title = {The {Landsat} 7 mission {Terrestrial} research and applications for the 21st century},
	abstract = {The Landsat Earth observation approach introduced in 1972 created a new way of monitoring land cover and land use globally. The Landsat 7 mission, successfully launched on April 15, 1999, continues those observations and demonstrates significant progress in precise numerical radiometry, spectral differentiation, and seasonally repetitive monitoring. Substantial improvements in calibration procedures, both prior to launch and during normal operations, have also been made to ensure long-term stability in the acquired spectral radiometry. Landsat 7 data acquisitions are being driven by a long-term data acquisition plan that was designed to ensure that substantially cloud-free, seasonal coverage would be recorded and archived in the US for all land areas of the globe. NASA competitively selected a Landsat Science Team, consisting of representatives from US universities and government agencies, to exploit the Landsat 7 record for global change research. This team is addressing the technical and analytical means to process and analyze the core of this observation record, and for the first time in the history of the Landsat mission, the technical and operational aspects of the mission are being driven by the goals of the US science community. The expected outcome of these efforts is a rapid improvement in understanding the Earth system, as well as conceptual knowledge that will underpin significant advancements in the application of this technology for commercial, operational, educational, and research purposes. Pathways to achieve effective Landsat continuity in the early decades of the 21st century are also being given careful attention, and there is no question that the lessons learned from the Landsat 7 mission will strongly influence these next-generation sensor systems.

Band 1 reflects blues and violets, where light is scattered by dust, smoke, and water particles in the air. Collecting data with enough sensitivity at this spectrum is difficult. Since water absorbs and scatters light, oceans and lakes tend to look dark or lack detail on satellite images. This is especially true in the sediment-laden waters near coastlines, where subtle differences in the color of intensity can indicate what is mixed in the water. Scientists have used the coastal band to monitor chlorophyll concentrations and suspended sediments in the water, as well as phytoplankton and algae blooms.

	abstract = {With an identical design and build, the Operational Land Imager-2 (OLI2) aboard Landsat-9 (L9) complements OLI observations by reducing the global revisit rate of Landsat to 8 days. This study takes advantage of near-coincident OLI2 and OLI observations obtained on 11–17 November 2021 to assess the relative quality of the standard United States Geological Survey (USGS) top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance (ρt) and atmospherically corrected reflectance (aquatic reflectance; ρwAR) products over bodies of water. The TOA assessment was carried out for all the visible bands, including the panchromatic band, as well as the near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands, whereas ρwAR products were analyzed in the 443, 482, 561, and 655 nm bands. The overlapping areas of OLI-OLI2 ρw product pairs were further analyzed for the rigor in corrections for the viewing geometry implemented in selected atmospheric correction (AC) processors, including SeaDAS, ACOLITE, and POLYMER, with products denoted as ρwAR, ρwac, and ρwpol, respectively. Overall, we found the OLI2-OLI ρt products to be consistent within 0.4\% in the visible-near-infrared (VNIR) bands except in the green band (561 nm), where OLI2 records ∼0.8\% larger values than OLI. The two SWIR bands (1610 and 2200 nm) were also found to agree within ∼2.2\% and 2.1\%, respectively, with OLI2 being lower in magnitude. The median differences in the standard ρw (ρwAR) were estimated to be ∼2.4\%, 1.5\%, 2.3\%, and 2.5\% in the 443, 482, 561, and 655 nm bands, respectively, which are well within the accepted differences in cross-mission data merging schemes. Further, we show that OLI2's signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is 7–30\% higher than that of OLI in all the bands, likely due to its 14-bit digitization rate, as compared to OLI's 12-bit digitization rate. Our self-consistency assessment of the AC processors for handling the differences in the view zenith angles (ΔVZA) and relative azimuth angles (ΔRAA) of OLI2 and OLI observations suggests that, overall, the processors account for the Sun-sensor geometry differently at different spectral bands. These differences (inconsistencies) amount to average median absolute percentage differences (MAPD) in ρw from 0.3 to 5.3\% (e.g., ∆ρwAR443nmΔVZAΔRAA=ρwAR,OLI443+6.310−ρwAR,OLI2443+3.9−13{\textless}0.5\%).More specifically, we found that SeaDAS provides the most optimal corrections for the angular variability as a function of VZA, ρwac are most consistent for different ranges of RAAs, and POLYMER performs best in the 443 nm band. We surmise that future (and other existing) AC methods should be tested with Landsat-8/-9 underfly imagery to quantify their performance for tackling the variability in imaging geometry and minimize associated uncertainties. With several missions planned for launch by the end of this decade, it is further emphasized that post-launch tandem maneuvers are essential to creating harmonized multi-mission data products and, therefore, similar operations should be considered and extended to ensure a broad range of environmental conditions are captured for comprehensive cross-mission analyses.},

It has changed over the years as technology has developed, both in terms of its function and its capabilities. During the World Wars, radar was brought into the open due to technological need. Many countries started their path toward building the radar around the 1930s. In spite of its limitations, it changed the course of World War II. Radar displayed extensive evolution every now and then as the field is not matured at all. Initially it displayed only the presence of ships. However, to fulfil the modern-day needs, it went through many revolutions. Analog computers were replaced by digital processors, high power transmitters switched from depending on microwave tubes to active arrays of antennas, and antennas went from being passive reflectors to active arrays. Thus, this paper examined the evolution of radar from its embryonic stage to modern age. In order to fulfill the demands of the future, this paper also look at the upcoming radar trends and possible solution.},

First, the PolSAR backscatter data, including four co /cross-polarized (XP) backscatter elements (i.e., the elements were not assumed to be zero) in a 3 × 3 covariance matrix, were decomposed into three components. Next, the decomposed XP backscatter determined each component’s scattering mechanism of the single, double, or volume scattering. Then, with backscatter models, we resolved the first ambiguity by considering the volume and single scattering mechanisms and the second ambiguity by studying the volume and double scattering mechanisms. Thus, the volume scattering, primarily from the XP backscatter, was used in both ambiguity removals. The algorithm was evaluated using multiple L-band PolSAR data. The average resolving rate of the two types of ambiguity was 74.3\%. Also, the relative powers of the single and double scattering mechanisms of radar targets decreased slightly (≤ 30.6\%) in absolute value, while the volume scattering increased significantly (≥ 91.9\%). The small change in the single or double scattering but the significant increase in the volume scattering quantitatively revealed the XP backscatter’s criticality. The volume scattering component is vital for understanding the PolSAR backscatter data in forested and urban environments.},

The results of estimating the coefficients in the correction-scheme relations from dual-wavelength polarimetric radar measurements of rainfall involving attenuating and nonattenuating frequencies are described. Such coefficients found directly from measurements are essentially free from different assumptions about drop shapes, drop size distributions, and/or relations between different radar variables that are typically used in many attenuation and differential attenuation correction schemes. Experimentally based estimates derived using dual-wavelength radar measurements conducted during a project in northern Colorado indicate values of the coefficients in the attenuation–differential phase quasi-linear relations at X band in the approximate range of 0.20–0.31 dB deg−1. The corresponding coefficients in the differential attenuation–differential phase relations are in the range of 0.052–0.065 dB deg−1.},

	abstract = {As the ocean development process speeds up, the technical means of ocean exploration are being upgraded. Due to the characteristics of seawater and the complex underwater environment, conventional measurement and sensing methods used for land are difficult to apply in the underwater environment directly. Especially for the seabed topography, it is impossible to carry out long-distance and accurate detection via electromagnetic waves. Therefore, various types of acoustic and even optical sensing devices for underwater applications have come into use. Equipped by submersibles, those underwater sensors can sense underwater wide-range and accurately. Moreover, the development of sensor technology will be modified and optimized according to the needs of ocean exploitation. This paper has made a summary of the ocean sensing technologies applied in some critical underwater scenarios, including geological surveys, navigation and communication, marine environmental parameters, and underwater inspections. In order to contain as many submersible-based sensors as possible, we have to make a trade-off on breadth and depth. In the end, the authors predict the development trend of underwater sensor technology based on the future ocean exploration requirements.},

In this study, we provide a new methodology, based on a function adjustment to the temperature profile, to locate the minimum and maximum depths of the strongest thermocline. We first validated our methodology by comparing the mixed layer depth obtained with the method proposed here with three other methods from previous studies. Since we found a very good agreement between the four methods we used the function adjustment to compute the monthly climatologies of the maximum thermocline depth and the thermocline thickness and strength in the global ocean. We also provide an assessment of the regions of the ocean where our adjustment is valid, i.e., where the thermal structure of the ocean follows the three-layer structure. However, there are ocean regions where the water column cannot be separated into three layers due to the dynamic processes that alter it. This assessment highlights the limitations of the existing methods to accurately determine the mixed layer depth and the thermocline depth in oceanic regions that are particularly turbulent such as the Southern Ocean and the northern North Atlantic, among others. The method proposed here has shown to be robust and easy to apply.},

	abstract = {The influence of upper ocean dynamics on the acoustic field in the South Eastern Arabian Sea (SEAS) is studied using in situ oceanographic/acoustic measurements from a moored buoy, along with satellite-derived and climatological data sets. Upper-ocean variability at the site is quantified using Mixed Layer Depth (MLD), Isothermal Layer Depth (ILD), Barrier Layer Thickness (BLT), Maximum Spice Depth (MSD), and Sonic Layer Depth (SLD), along with surface variability factors such as Sea Surface Temperature, Sea Surface Salinity, Spice, and Sea Level Anomaly. The mixed layer acoustic duct (MLAD) varies from 2 to 100 m, with BLT varying from 5 to 99 m, and a mean SLD of 43 m. A thick transition layer connects the mixed layer with the thermocline during winter. The observations reveal that maximum SLD, MSD, and BLT occurred during January–March. Unlike other seasons when SLD follows MLD, winter SLD is influenced by BLT, suggesting strong salinity stratification due to low-salinity water intrusion from the Bay of Bengal by East India Coastal Current. During these months, the SLD varies from 80 to 100 m, with the corresponding minimum cut-off frequency varying from 300 to 200 Hz. Results are correlated with estimated Sound Pressure Level (SPL) from Ambient Noise Measurements during November 2018 to November 2019. SPL variation follows SLD for low and mid-frequencies, with the highest SPL noted during January-February. Acoustic propagation simulations at 250 and 1,000 Hz revealed features like acoustic duct leakage and channeling, indicating energy transfers between the surface acoustic duct and deeper layers.},

It is known that acoustic remote sensing is the most widely used technique for depth measurement. Survey systems can be embedded on various platforms and also provide different accuracies. Coupled to these systems are also Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), auxiliary sensors and speed profilers, improving the accuracy of the data obtained. Alternatively to the use of echo sounders, optical sensing (active and passive sensors) or satellite radar altimetry can be used to estimate depth. Thus, this study aims to present an overview of bathymetric survey methodologies, as well as the evolution of the use of sounding platforms, systems and sensors and various existing technologies. In addition, the main uncertainties involved and the advantages and disadvantages of the available solutions are also evidenced, providing the reader the ability to choose the most appropriate technique.},

	abstract = {The remote sensing community has identified data fusion as one of the key challenging topics of the 21st century. The subject of image fusion in two-dimensional (2D) space has been covered in several published reviews. However, the special case of 2.5D/3D Digital Elevation Model (DEM) fusion has not been addressed till date. DEM fusion is a key application of data fusion in remote sensing. It takes advantage of the complementary characteristics of multi-source DEMs to deliver a more complete, accurate, and reliable elevation dataset. Although several methods for fusing DEMs have been developed, the absence of a well-rounded review has limited their proliferation among researchers and end-users. Combining knowledge from multiple studies is often required to inform a holistic perspective and guide further research. In response, this paper provides a systematic review of DEM fusion: the pre-processing workflow, methods and applications, enhanced with a meta-analysis. Through the discussion and comparative analysis, unresolved challenges and open issues are identified, and future directions for research are proposed. This review is a timely solution and an invaluable source of information for researchers within the fields of remote sensing and spatial information science, and the data fusion community at large.},

	abstract = {Digital elevation models (DEMs) provide fundamental depictions of the three-dimensional shape of the Earth’s surface and are useful to a wide range of disciplines. Ideally, DEMs record the interface between the atmosphere and the lithosphere using a discrete two-dimensional grid, with complexities introduced by the intervening hydrosphere, cryosphere, biosphere, and anthroposphere. The treatment of DEM surfaces, affected by these intervening spheres, depends on their intended use, and the characteristics of the sensors that were used to create them. DEM is a general term, and more specific terms such as digital surface model (DSM) or digital terrain model (DTM) record the treatment of the intermediate surfaces. Several global DEMs generated with optical (visible and near-infrared) sensors and synthetic aperture radar (SAR), as well as single/multi-beam sonars and products of satellite altimetry, share the common characteristic of a georectified, gridded storage structure. Nevertheless, not all DEMs share the same vertical datum, not all use the same convention for the area on the ground represented by each pixel in the DEM, and some of them have variable data spacings depending on the latitude. This paper highlights the importance of knowing, understanding and reflecting on the sensor and DEM characteristics and consolidates terminology and definitions of key concepts to facilitate a common understanding among the growing community of DEM users, who do not necessarily share the same background.},

	abstract = {Coastal zones, where land meets ocean, are home to a large portion of the global population and play a crucial role in human survival and development. These regions are shaped by complex geological processes and influenced by both natural and anthropogenic factors, making effective management essential for addressing population growth, environmental degradation, and resource sustainability. However, the inherent complexity of coastal zones complicates their study, and traditional in situ methods are often inefficient. Remote sensing technologies have significantly advanced coastal zone research, with different sensors providing diverse perspectives. These sensors are typically used for classification tasks (e.g., coastline extraction, coastal classification) and retrieval tasks (e.g., aquatic color, wetland monitoring). Recent improvements in resolution and the advent of deep learning have led to notable progress in classification, while platforms like Google Earth Engine (GEE) have enabled the development of high-quality, global-scale products. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of coastal zone interpretation, discussing platforms, sensors, spectral characteristics, and key challenges while proposing potential solutions for future research and management.},

	abstract = {Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) play a critical role in hydrologic and hydraulic modeling. Flood inundation mapping is highly dependent on the accuracy of DEMs. Various vertical differences exist among open access DEMs as they use various observation satellites and algorithms. The problem is particularly acute in small, flat coastal cities. Thus, it is necessary to assess the differences of the input of DEMs in flood simulation and to reduce anomalous errors of DEMs. In this study, we first conducted urban flood simulation in the Huangpu River Basin in Shanghai by using the LISFLOOD-FP hydrodynamic model and six open-access DEMs (SRTM, MERIT, CoastalDEM, GDEM, NASADEM, and AW3D30), and analyzed the differences in the results of the flood inundation simulations. Then, we processed the DEMs by using two statistically based methods and compared the results with those using the original DEMs. The results show that: (1) the flood inundation mappings using the six original DEMs are significantly different under the same simulation conditions—this indicates that only using a single DEM dataset may lead to bias of flood mapping and is not adequate for high confidence analysis of exposure and flood management; and (2) the accuracy of a DEM corrected by the Dixon criterion for predicting inundation extent is improved, in addition to reducing errors in extreme water depths—this indicates that the corrected datasets have some performance improvement in the accuracy of flood simulation. A freely available, accurate, high-resolution DEM is needed to support robust flood mapping. Flood-related researchers, practitioners, and other stakeholders should pay attention to the uncertainty caused by DEM quality.},

	abstract = {Snow modelling is often hampered by the availability of input and calibration data, which can affect the choice of models, their complexity, and transferability. To address the trade-off between model parsimony and transferability, we present the Generalizable Empirical Model of Snow Accumulation and Melt (GEMS), a machine-learning-based model, which requires only daily precipitation, temperature or its daily diurnal cycle, and basic topographic features to simulate snow water equivalent (SWE). The model embeds a support vector regression pretrained on a large dataset of daily observations from a diverse set of the SNOwpack TELemetry Network (SNOTEL) stations in the United States. GEMS does not require any user calibration, except for the option to adjust the temperature threshold for rain–snow partitioning, though the model achieves robust simulation results with the default value. We validated the model with long-term daily observations from numerous independent SNOTEL stations not included in the training and with data from reference stations of the Earth System Model–Snow Model Intercomparison Project. We demonstrate how the model advances large-scale SWE modelling in regions with complex terrain that lack in situ snow mass observations for calibration, such as the Pamir and Andes mountains, by assessing the model's ability to reproduce daily snow cover dynamics. Future model improvements should consider the effects of vegetation, improve simulation accuracy for shallow snow in warm locations at lower elevations, and possibly address wind-induced snow redistribution. Overall, GEMS provides a new approach for snow modelling that can be useful for hydroclimatic research and operational monitoring in regions where in situ snow observations are scarce.},

	abstract = {The species distribution model (SDM), which is used to spatially predict species distributions, can also identify the probable causes of the location of certain species (i.e. the mathematical description of habitat requirements). Therefore, SDM has the potential to guide resource management and biodiversity conservation. In the topographically complex terrain, SDMs are often complicated by the lack of environmental data; however, the first information that is typically obtained for these analyses is a topographic map. Here, the possibility of using 16 predictor variables derived from the digital elevation model (DEM) to model the distributions of Abies faxoniana and Quercus aquifolioides in the mountainous upstream catchment basin of the Min River (UCBM) in southwest China was investigated. In particular, with the ensemble modeling approach based on eight niche models and nine model-training and -testing datasets, changes in model performance and shifts in the explanatory power of the predictor variable over five different levels of spatial resolution (30m, 90m, 120m, 240m, 900m) were assessed. Almost all models succeed in predicting the distributions of both species, although predictive accuracies differed significantly among spatial scales and model classes. On average, model accuracies increased to the highest level at the meso-scale (120m and 240m for A. faxoniana and Q. aquifolioides, respectively) and then decreased as resolution became coarser, indicating that high spatial resolution does not imply a better model. The relative importance rankings for each topographical variable were consistent across all spatial scales, but their explanatory powers did differ significantly among spatial scales. Elevation and terrain-distributed solar radiation for growing season (SRG) drive the distributions of A. faxoniana and Q. aquifolioides with a much higher level of confidence than other predictors across all spatial scales; the former tended to decrease, and the latter tended to increase when spatial resolution became coarse. Our findings confirm that DEM can be used exclusively and effectively to predict species distribution. Multi-scale analysis is needed to detect highly subtle variations in species habitat requirements, and to select the spatial scale that corresponds to known spatial characteristics of the species habitat. This has broad implications for distribution modeling of species in rugged terrain.},

	abstract = {The European Space Agency (ESA) is using PlanetDEM for the generation of their Sentinel-2 Level-1C orthophotos. There are concerns that this DEM is not accurate enough for this purpose, especially over mountainous regions like in Austria. In this study, we investigate the height accuracy of PlanetDEM in Austria by comparing it with a reference DEM that is derived from airborne laser scanning. Afterwards, we predict the errors in the Sentinel orthophotos that are caused by these DEM errors: 99.8\% of all pixels have a PlanetDEM-induced displacement between ±10 m (i.e. one Sentinel-2 pixel) for all investigated four satellite tracks over Austria. Still, at a few spots, the location errors can reach 60 m. ESA’s goal is to achieve a multi-temporal geo-registration quality (for Level-1C products) of 3 m (95.5\% confidence) once the Global Reference Image is established. If we assume that this error budget consists partly of a georeferencing and partly of a DEM-induced error and both are equal, then the DEM-induced error may only amount to 2 m. In this case, PlanetDEM would not allow for this accuracy in the mountainous regions, because there, according to the predictions of this study, 95.5\% of the errors are between ±3.8 m.},

Therefore, multi-sources remote sensing images covering various terrain in China are experimented for the analysis of ortho-rectification accuracy using different DEMs. Based on the rational function model, the geolocation error of original imagery can be reduced greatly with the grounds control points, and different DEMs are used for the ortho-rectification of different imagery. The accuracy is experimented and verified using high-precision reference images. Experimental results show that ortho-rectificated images with the ALOS DEM can achieve better accuracy compared with the SRTM DEM and ASTER GDEM, which is significant for geometric processing of remote sensing images.},

	abstract = {A first assessment of the TanDEM-X DEMs over Brazilian territory is presented through a comparison with SRTM, ASTER GDEM and ALOS AW3D30 DEMs in seven study areas with distinct geomorphological contexts, vegetation coverage, and land use. Visual analysis and elevation histograms point to a finer effective spatial (i.e., horizontal) resolution of TanDEM-X compared to SRTM and ASTER GDEM. In areas of open vegetation, TanDEM-X lower elevations indicate a deeper penetration of the radar signal. DEMs of differences (DoDs) allowed the identification of issues inherent to the production methods of the analyzed DEMs, such as mast oscillations in SRTM data and mismatch between adjacent scenes in ASTER GDEM and ALOS AW3D30. A systematic difference in elevations between TanDEM-X 12 m, TanDEM-X 30 m, and SRTM was observed in the steep slopes of the coastal ranges, related to the moving-window process used to resample the 12 m data to a 30 m pixel size. It is strongly recommended to produce a DoD with SRTM before using ASTER GDEM or ALOS AW3D30 in any analysis, to evaluate if the area of interest is affected by these problems. The DoDs also highlighted changes in land use in the time span between the acquisition of SRTM (2000) and TanDEM-X (2013) data, whether by natural causes or by human interference in the environment. The results show a high level of detail and consistency for TanDEM-X data, indicate that the effective horizontal resolution of SRTM is coarser than the nominal 30 m, and highlight the errors in ASTER GDEM and ALOS AW3D30 due to mismatch between adjacent scenes in the photogrammetric process.},
